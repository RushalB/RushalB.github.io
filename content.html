<p class="text-block-5">Based on the insights gained during the project kickoff meeting
    with the client regarding their requirements and target audience, we formulated a questionnaire
    aimed at diving deeper into the users' pain points and frustrations.
    We asked them questions about their current method of record keeping and what their frustrations
    are.<br>
    Since Simplifi focuses on micro-business owners we found and recruited various types og owners
    ranging from free lancers to small shop owners.

<p class="text-block-4"> Interview </p>
<p class="text-block-5">
    We conducted paired interviews, with one person as the interviewer and the other as the note-taker.
    Starting with questions about their background, we aimed to understand their business better,
    fostering trust. Interviews were semi-structured and took place in casual settings, mainly their
    shops or on campus. We then explored their current practices and how our new features could enhance
    their workflow. We delved into their existing tools and methods, identifying their shortcomings.
    Specifically, we investigated their tax preparation methods and how they manage both personal and
    business finances. Additionally, we gained insights into their project and client tracking processes
    if applicable.

    We divided the app into sections and distributed these sections amongst our team
    mates
    Each member evaluated the section based on the the 10 heuristics proposed by Neilsen and Norman and ranked the by
    priorty
    We combined our results and used an affinity map to analyze the common flaws and shortcomings in the app

Usability testing started off with recruiting. We recruited people who were micro-business owners similar to the ones in
our persona.We recruited people from our team members circles,Linkedin and students in our college who had their own
micro-business/side-hustles.
We scheduled hour long interviews with each user and had them complete 3 tasks using the Quicken Simplifi App.These
tasks were devised in such a manner that the user would exlpore most of the app's features we were working on.After
getting their consesnt user's actions and thoughts we recorded while they completed the tasks.
All the notes were collected and combined removing any identification of the user. These notes were then grouped into
categories to find out common things that users found difficult to use or were confused about.We also grouped these
themes according to the section of the app we were analyzing. Based on these findings we curated some recommendations
for our client
