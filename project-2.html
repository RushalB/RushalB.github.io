                    <div class="paragraph-light cc-position-name">The problem we are hoping to address is issues of
                        communication between consumers ofdrinking water in the greater Detroit area and the water
                        department, specifically in relation toaged infrastructure. The aging infrastructure in Detroit
                        has been a leading problem for decadesand has recently affected the city through flooding and
                        interruption of services. The stakeholder sare the Detroit City Council, Citizens of Detroit,
                        and the Detroit Waste and Sewerage Company.Each group communicates infrastructure issues, but
                        information is fragmented between themwith the current channels of communication and issues
                        continue to arise with flooding.The challenges associated with this problem are equatable to the
                        larger issuessurrounding the topic of drinking water safety at both the national and state
                        levels. When working within the confines of specific municipalities, like Detroit, a message has
                        the potentialto become burdened by excessive technical and legal jargon throughout its
                        processing which canoften alienate its audience. Beyond the vocabulary used during the process,
                        there are alsologistical factors that pose the risk of appearing overwhelming while increasing
                        uncertainty inthe proper routes, such as rampant departmentalization throughout the city
                        government. Citizens are given some avenues in which to communicate their concerns with the
                        Improve Detroit app and the DWSC’s website. This is still not enough after gaining some insight
                        from a resident and as well as a representative from DWSC.If this problem is not addressed,
                        there is a potential that residents will not feel confidentsubmitting claims.With the research
                        we have now our questions have shifted to more actionable ways to improve these communication
                        channels. We know how the community can be involved in improving infrastructure but the question
                        now is how do we present this information in a way that is clearly visible and understandable?
                        Also , is it possible that more visually charged content like video’s change the citizens&#x27;
                        understanding of issues and work being done?<strong>Process</strong> Team Huron chose to look at
                        the issue of communication in relation to water infrastructure. Team Huron used methods such as
                        researching recent water infrastructure issues and existing communication tools to scope
                        possible problems related to this topic. While conducting background research, Team Huron looked
                        at official datasets and reports from the City of Detroit that put recent drinking water and
                        sewerage problems into context with what residents had experienced. This was done to understand
                        why establishing effective communication strategies is so important. Also, Team Huron populated
                        a list of current communication tools that both residents and city officials could use, such as
                        the ImproveDetroit mobile app, the Detroit Water &amp; Sewerage Department website portal, and
                        environmental activist groups. This information was found from websites and articles. This
                        research led Team Huron to narrow down the problem statement to address communication pain
                        points between residents of Detroit and the Detroit Water &amp; Sewerage Department. After the
                        problem was scoped, Team Huron continued to collect information on communication between
                        residents and city workers. Several SME interviews of individuals that work in the water field
                        provided more real-world examples of communication strategies that city workers are using. Some
                        also gave insight into how the interviewees felt about residents communicating back to them.
                        However, these interviews were also limiting in that this topic was often not the main focus of
                        the conversation. Team Huron understood that they needed to interview individuals on their own
                        so the conversation could focus around the research problem and they gain perspectives from both
                        sides–the resident and city official sides. The first interview that Team Huron conducted was
                        with the Public Affairs Director of the Detroit Water &amp; Sewerage Department. This interview
                        provided information and perspective from one side of the problem statement, that of the city
                        officials. The interviewee talked at length about the various methods that their department used
                        to communicate with residents, including many Team Huron had not found during their initial
                        research. The second interview was with a resident of Detroit. This interview supplied the other
                        side, the resident side, of the research problem. Team Huron was able to gain perspective on
                        what a resident thought about existing communication tools and paint points they hadn’t
                        considered before. With all of this data collected, Team Huron felt prepared to move on to
                        analysis. The data sources can be found .Team Huron’s data analysis involved identifying trends
                        within communication strategies that various interviewees spoke about, diagnosing possible pain
                        points that caused issues between residents and city officials, and looking for additional
                        patterns or conflicting information from the two interviewees. Team Huron did all of this while
                        creating the affinity wall. Data was grouped into either resident and city official information
                        to better understand the relationship between the two of them. This also allowed Team Huron to
                        identify the similarities and differences in how the interviewees approached and understood each
                        other and how they utilized communication tools. With background knowledge of existing problems
                        with Detroit’s water infrastructure and communication tools, Team Huron was able to analyze the
                        results of our interviews to see what findings they provided in relation to the problem
                        statement.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Make small</strong></div>
